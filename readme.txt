Amplify is a direct-text marketing and sales system that allows you to instantly sell your WooCommerce store products via text.

== Description ==

Amplify enables your WooCommerce store to sell any of your products through Amplify’s unique and powerful in-text sales and payments channel to customers that opt-in to receive text marketing messages from your store. Customers can complete purchases of your WooCommerce products inside their smartphone’s native text application without having to leave the text conversation with your store.

>Coupled with Amplify's highly intuitive and in-depth customer database, which reflects all store products, customer purchase history and demographics, WooCommerce store owners can now easily create and manage highly focused customizable MMS/SMS text marketing and sales campaigns to specific customer segments they define.
>
>As your customers interact with your WooCommerce store, additional data points are gathered that expand the demographic insights in your Amplify account to help you better understand where your brand captures the highest returns.
